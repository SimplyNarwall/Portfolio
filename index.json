As a player, you engage in action games to learn her movement principles and, guided by Virtual Loïe, explore her world. You will use modern VR technology to create your own unique dance, becoming a Master Dancer yourself! Star Maker # Star maker is one of the minigames meant to teach players dance principles. In this game, players must hit orbs flying at them towards targets in time with the music. The core design pillars of Star Maker are to teach players to do strong, direct movements, have players feel in tune with the music, and to be very forgiving in gameplay.\nNotable Features # Designed an orb trajectory prediction system so that the orb hits targets when it appears to from the player\u0026rsquo;s perspective. Designed an aim assist feature to make game feel more satisfying. The strength is linearly curved so that wildly inaccurate hit will still be very off, while closer hits will hit the target. Adjusted aim assist strength through multiple playtest sessions. Designed a music looping system in order to give players multiple tries while maintaining the musicality of the game. Orb Trajectory # Loop System # Music Roundabout # Music Roundabout (called Music Game while in development) is another minigame meant to teach players dance principles. In this game, players will activate orbs which rotate around them, creating a melody. The core design pillars of Music Roundabout are to teach players twisting motion, as well as a light tapping motion. In addition, players should feel as though they are creating music as they play.\nNotable Features # Designed an orb charging system to incentivize players to move and twist naturally. Designed visual indicators for players to know when to activate orbs, even with no sound. Orb Charging # Visual Indicators # Limited Arc # Examples of Work # Mockup/Art Reference for some of the tutorial systems. Art reference board for the \u0026ldquo;Hub Room\u0026rdquo; of the game.
