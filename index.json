What I did # Wrote initial game concept summary Designed and balanced player stats, items, and disasters Programmed disasters, loot drops, player stats, UI, and Sound Game Overview # Holoswipe is a fast-paced 3d roguelike where the objective is to survive one week as an obsessed Hololive Fan. Each day you must buy run around booths to collect coins and buy enough merch to prove your allegiance. Merch items give you stats in return which can increase your income, discount items, or help you avoid money-stealing disasters. Gameplay Samples # Players are incentivized to run around the map for as long as possible in order to collect pickups and increase their income. However, they must be sure to avoid money-deducting disasters. Players have limited inventory space, and must reorganize it to collect more powerful or efficient items as the game goes on. Feature Design # The goal of the game is to get enough fan score each day to reach the next day. This is similar to games like balatro, where the only objective is to get your score high enough to win.\nMoney: Players obtain money in 2 ways, through coins which spawn randomly and frequently around the map and salary, a flat sum of money which is\nItems: Items will spawn in set areas in the map, and can be bought with money. With some exceptions, item spawns will always be random, though the location they spawn is the same each time. Items are the core of the gameplay, and the only way for players to increase their stats and fanscore enough to reach the target. The randomness of item spawns means that hopefully players will be able to find different good starting items across several playthroughs.\nLimited inventory: Players have a limited space to hold items, and players can organize their inventory to hold more. This allows for a slight optimization minigame, as well as providing for more item balancing levers (items that are cheaper are stronger earlier on when inventory space isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue, whereas items that take up less space are more useful later when the player has a strong economy built). Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s just cool to see the item sprites their in your inventory.\nDisasters: Disasters are thematic events which can impede the player\u0026rsquo;s movement, or steal their money. These are mainly intended to keep players on their toes and moving all the time, increasing tension, as well as providing homage to Hololive members.\nLoot spawns: Loot spawns are the counterpart to disasters. Since the player can simply leave the convention early if they want, these loot spawns incentivize the player to stay in the convention for as long as they can, as well as providing exciting moments where players can be dropped expensive items.\nTime limit: Each day, there is a time limit before the player will be chased out by enemies which get increasingly faster and deduct a large sum of money if they reach. The idea behind these enemies is to allow a slight bit of leeway to the player, as well as letting players to feel how much \u0026ldquo;stronger\u0026rdquo; they are later in the game. Since the enemies slowly scale up their speed, high speed builds will be able to run from them for longer, and create fun moments.\nItem Balance # Overall philosophy: While testing, I found that there were numerous times where the best strategy was simply amassing a large sum of fan score through items. While optimal, it felt terrible, as the items the player would buy would keep them at near base stats throughout the entire playthrough, resulting in them feeling the same at the end of the game as they do at the start. Because of this, a lot of the stat allocation and balancing is intended to incentivize players to get a wide variety of stats so they feel much stronger by the end, almost as though they\u0026rsquo;re cheating. Most viable builds will include comically high speed, enough luck to make it rain loot, or so much discount that items are practically free, allowing for a satisfying sense of progression.\nPosters and pins: special items which give increased stats based on the other items in your inventory. These are the cruxes of our archetypes, and powerful items which players should feel happy to build around.\nPlushies: Items which always spawn in the same location and give pure fanscore. These are intentionally extremely understatted for 2 reasons: The fact that these always spawn means that they would reduce variation and replayability. Additionally, since they don\u0026rsquo;t give any stat other than fanscore, they don\u0026rsquo;t make the player feel any stronger. However, they are useful later on, as they take up very little space, and players who have an excess of money can buy them to fill in their empty inventory slots efficiently.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Portfolio/projects/holoswipe/","section":"Projects","summary":"A fast paced shopping spree roguelike created for HoloJam 6","title":"HoloSwipe","type":"projects"},{"content":" Your browser does not support the video tag. Team Size/Time constraint # Worked as the lead of design in a team of 9, starting in Oct 2024, currently ongoing. What I did # Lead all design decisions, working in several design disciplines such as Mechanics, Technical, UX, QA etc. Authored 20+ design documents, including Gameplay Loops, Feature Breakdowns, Asset Lists, etc. Worked in Unreal Engine to implement and balance level designs Game Overview # In Master Dancer, you meet the famous dancer Loïe Fuller, the first to integrate technology into modern dance. As a player, you engage in action games to learn her movement principles and, guided by Virtual Loïe, explore her world. You will use modern VR technology to create your own unique dance, becoming a Master Dancer yourself! Star Maker # Star maker is one of the minigames meant to teach players dance principles. In this game, players must hit orbs flying at them towards targets in time with the music. The core design pillars of Star Maker are to teach players to do strong, direct movements, have players feel in tune with the music, and to be very forgiving in gameplay.\nNotable Features # Designed an orb trajectory prediction system so that the orb hits targets when it appears to from the player\u0026rsquo;s perspective. Designed an aim assist feature to make game feel more satisfying. The strength is linearly curved so that wildly inaccurate hit will still be very off, while closer hits will hit the target. Adjusted aim assist strength through multiple playtest sessions. Designed a music looping system in order to give players multiple tries, reducing frustrayion while maintaining the musicality of the game. Music Roundabout # Music Roundabout (called Music Game while in development) is another minigame meant to teach players dance principles. In this game, players will activate orbs which rotate around them, creating a melody. The core design pillars of Music Roundabout are to teach players twisting motion, as well as a light tapping motion. In addition, players should feel as though they are creating music as they play.\nNotable Features # Designed an orb charging system where players had to follow the rotating orb with their hand to incentivize players to twist their hips naturally. Designed visual indicators for players to know when to activate orbs, even with no sound (Although, sound was of course vital for this minigame). Chose to limit the arc of the orb, from traversing in a full circle to a half circle, to prevent players from getting dizzy and tangled in the VR headset\u0026rsquo;s wire.
