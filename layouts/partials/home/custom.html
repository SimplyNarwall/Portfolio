<section class="prose dark:prose-invert"><p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Ethan, an undergrad at UIUC and aspiring game developer. When I&rsquo;m not lying in bed, spending time with friends, or doing flips at the gym, I like to spend time researching and working on game design. I also have a strong background in programming, especially in C# and Java.</p>
