    <p>Hi, I’m Ethan, an undergraduate student at UIUC and aspiring game developer. With a strong foundation in programming—especially C# and Java—I have dedicated much of my life to developing video games. Beyond my programming skills, I possess years of experience design small to medium scale projects for game jams and my univeristy job, as well as leadership experience from Gamebuilders, where I’ve worked hard to foster a strong and collaborative community. Whether coding mechanics, writing design docs, or collaborating with other game devs, I aim to keep things fun for both players and everyone around me. 
    <br />  
    <br />  
    When I’m not immersed in game development, I enjoy connecting with friends, honing my athletic skills with flips at the gym, and lying motionless in bed.</p>
