      <p>Hi, I’m Ethan, an undergraduate student at UIUC and aspiring game developer. With a strong foundation in programming—especially C# and Java—I have dedicated much of my life to developing video games. Beyond my technical skills, I possess leadership experience from Gamebuilders-A club at UIUC-where I’ve worked to foster a more collaborative environment. Whether coding mechanics, studying games, or writing design docs of my own, I aim to keep things fun for myself, the players, and everyone around me.

When I’m not immersed in game development, I enjoy connecting with friends, honing my athletic skills with flips at the gym, and lying motionless in bed.</p>
