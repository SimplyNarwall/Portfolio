      <p>Hi, I’m Ethan, an undergraduate student at UIUC and aspiring game developer. With a strong foundation in programming—especially C# and Java—I have dedicated much of my life to developing video games. Beyond my programming skills, I possess years of experience design small to medium scale projects for game jams and my univeristy job, as well as leadership experience from Gamebuilders-A club at UIUC-where I’ve worked hard to foster a strong and collaborative community. Whether coding mechanics, studying games, or writing design docs of my own, I aim to keep things fun for myself, the players, and everyone around me.</p>

      <p>When I’m not immersed in game development, I enjoy connecting with friends, honing my athletic skills with flips at the gym, and lying motionless in bed.</p>
