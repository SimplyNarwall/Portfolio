### Hi, I'm Ethan, an undergrad at UIUC and aspiring game developer. When I'm not lying in bed, spending time with friends, or doing flips at the gym, I like to spend time researching and working on game design. I also have a strong background in programming, especially in C# and Java.

### Most importantly, I've recently reached Challenger in TFT.
