### I am Ethan Wang, an undergrad at UIUC and aspiring game developer. When I'm not in bed, spending time with friends, or doing flips at the gym, I like to spend time researching and working on game design. I also have a fairly strong background in programming, especially in C# and Java.

### Most importantly, I'm Challenger in TFT.
