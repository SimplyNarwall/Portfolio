## Overview
- Bike the Bullet is a fast-paced 2d shoot em' up created for MonkeyJam2024. You play as popular Twitch Streamer CDawgVA and you have been tasked by the God of Bike to defeat Boss Grizzle and his goons. With anthromorphic animals and bikes and weapons/voicelines inspired by Connor and his friends, Bike the Bullet is a short but fun and challenging time waster.

## Gameplay Samples

Players can collects power ups to give them stronger attacks. This one is an explosive attack, based off a friend of CDawgVA who has an obsession with fried chicken.<p><img src="powerup.gif" width="640" height = "360"></p>


In phase 1 of the boss, the player fights against the boss' top brass. Be wary of when you defeat them, as the boss can use their vacant motorcycles as deadly projectiles.
