## Overview
- Bike the Bullet is a fast-paced 2d shoot em' up created for MonkeyJam2024. You play as popular Twitch Streamer CDawgVA and you have been tasked by the God of Bike to defeat Boss Grizzle and his goons. With anthromorphic animals and bikes and weapons/voicelines inspired by Connor and his friends, Bike the Bullet is a short but fun and challenging time waster.

## Team Size/Time constraint
- Worked as the lead programmer and designer in a team of 4, for a 3 day Game Jam.

## What I did
- Wrote GDD summary
- Designed weapon types, enemy movement and attack patterns
- Programmed nearly the entire game using Unity.

## Core Goals
- Follow the themes: Cycling (the game jam theme), &  CDawgVA (The who hosted the game jam).
- Create a game with immediate impact on players.
- Create a simple game that anyone can enjoy and succeed in.

To follow these core goals, we decided to create a simple cycling shoot 'em up game with streamer themed power ups. The game is complete with a riveting plot, striking stylized artstyle, a mafia gang composed of vehicle riding animals, and a boss so large he doesn't even fit on screen.

## Notable features

### Power ups
Player collects a power up to give them a new explosive attack based on Chris Broad, a friend of CDawgVA with an obsession with fried chicken.<p><img src="powerup.gif" width="640" height = "360"></p>


### Boss fight
The player defeats a minion, and the boss throws the now vacant motorcycle at them

After all of the boss' minions are dead, they take matters into their own hands
