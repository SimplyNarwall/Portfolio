## Overview
- Triplight is a 2d turn based puzzle game centering around the idea of lasers. The goal of each level is to reach the flag at the end by passing through lasers, crates and a variety of other obstacles. As you complete levels, more mechanics continue to be gradually added to create a variety of fun, interesting, and challenging levels.
