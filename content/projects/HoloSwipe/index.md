## Game Overview
- Holoswipe is a fast-paced 3d roguelike where the objective is to survive one week as an obsessed Hololive Fan. Each day you must buy run around booths to collect coins and buy enough merch to prove your allegiance. Merch items give you stats in return which can increase your income, discount items, or help you avoid money-stealing disasters. 

## Gameplay Samples

Players can collects power ups to give them stronger attacks. This one is an explosive attack, based off a friend of CDawgVA who has an obsession with fried chicken.<p><img src="powerup.gif" width="640" height = "360"></p>


In phase 1 of the boss, the player fights against the boss' top brass. Be wary of when you defeat them, as the boss can use their vacant motorcycles as deadly projectiles.
