## Game Overview
- Holoswipe is a fast-paced 3d roguelike where the objective is to survive one week as an obsessed Hololive Fan. Each day you must buy run around booths to collect coins and buy enough merch to prove your allegiance. Merch items give you stats in return which can increase your income, discount items, or help you avoid money-stealing disasters. 

## Gameplay Samples

Players are incentivized to run around the map for as long as possible in order to collect pickups and increase their income. However, they must be sure to avoid money-deducting disasters.

Players have limited inventory space, and must reorganize it to collect more powerful items as the game goes on.
