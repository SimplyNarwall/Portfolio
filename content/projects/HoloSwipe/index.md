## Team Size/Time constraint
- Worked as a programmer and designer in a team of 4, for a 2 week long Game Jam.

## What I did
- Wrote initial game concept summary
- Designed and balanced player stats, items, and disasters
- Programmed disasters, loot drops, player stats, UI, and Sound

## Game Overview
- Holoswipe is a fast-paced 3d roguelike where the objective is to survive one week as an obsessed Hololive Fan. Each day you must buy run around booths to collect coins and buy enough merch to prove your allegiance. Merch items give you stats in return which can increase your income, discount items, or help you avoid money-stealing disasters. 

## Gameplay Samples

- Players are incentivized to run around the map for as long as possible in order to collect pickups and increase their income. However, they must be sure to avoid money-deducting disasters.

- Players have limited inventory space, and must reorganize it to collect more powerful or efficient items as the game goes on.

## Feature Design
- The goal of the game is to get enough fan score each day to reach the next day. This is similar to games like balatro, where the only objective is to get your score high enough to win.

- Money: Players obtain money in 2 ways, through coins which spawn randomly and frequently around the map and salary, a flat sum of money which is 

- Items: Items will spawn in set areas in the map, and can be bought with money. With some exceptions, item spawns will always be random, though the location they spawn is the same each time. Items are the core of the gameplay, and the only way for players to increase their stats and fanscore enough to reach the target.

- Limited inventory: Players have a limited space to hold items, and players can organize their inventory to hold more. This allows for a slight optimization minigame, as well as providing for more item balancing levers (items that are cheaper are stronger earlier on when inventory space isn't an issue, whereas items that take up less space are more useful later when the player has a strong economy built). Additionally, it's just cool to see the item sprites their in your inventory. 

- Disasters: Thematic events which can impede the player's movement, or steal their money. These are mainly intended to keep players on their toes and moving all the time, increasing tension, as well as providing homage to Hololive members.

- Loot spawns: The counterpart to disasters. Since the player can simply leave the convention early if they want, these loot spawns incentivize the player to stay in the convention for as long as they can, as well as providing exciting moments where players can be dropped expensive items.

Time limit: Each day, there is a time limit before the player will be chased out by enemies which get increasingly faster and deduct a large sum of money if they reach. The idea behind these enemies is to allow a slight bit of leeway to the player, as well as letting players to feel how much "stronger" they are later in the game. Since the enemies slowly scale up their speed, high speed builds will be able to run from them for longer, and create fun moments.


## Item Balance
- Posters and pins: special items which give increased stats based on the other items in your inventory
- Plushies: Items which always spawn in the same location and give pure fanscore. These are intentionally extremely understatted for 2 reasons: The fact that these always spawn (as opposed to other items which spawn randomly) means that
